## Introduction
Solution to matlab problems of Dr.AmirMazlaghani final project of Engineering Mathematics course.

## Question one
We want to forecast weather with markov model, Assume we have following table for weather:

| Tomorrow / Today | Sunny | Cloudy | Rainy |
|:---------------- |:-----:|:------:|:-----:|
| Sunny            |  0.4  |  0.3   |  0.1  |
| Cloudy           |  0.4  |  0.3   |  0.6  |
| Rainy            |  0.2  |  0.4   |  0.3  |

and then we create some awsome code in [01.m](01.m).

## Question Two
Let's compress our image with SVD.
